Voice commands for the raspberry pi

I use the Raspberry Pi for home automation. I have an Arduino Uno + Ethernet shield hoocked up to my central door unlocking system. By accessing the Arduinos webinterface with the pi, I can open my door via voice commands.
For optimal usage a usb mic and speakers/headphones should be connected.
